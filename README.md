HPC21 repo for Ex. 2.1,Ex. 2.2, and Ex 2.3

% g++ --version: g++ (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)

Some results for Ex. 2.2 in the latex file homework.tex

Not too sure about these results ... I got different results 
on an iMAC ...

For Ex 2.3, on my iMAC compiling with -O3 removed
the REPEAT loops -- VERY fast timing results ...
 
(I'm auditing this class...)
